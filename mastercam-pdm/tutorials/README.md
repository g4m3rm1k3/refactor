## 📖 How to Use This Tutorial

### Recommended Approach:
1. **Read the chapter first** - Understand the concepts before coding
2. **Code along incrementally** - Type the code yourself, don't just copy/paste
3. **Test frequently** - Run your code after each section
4. **Experiment** - Try modifying the code to see what happens
5. **Review previous chapters** - Concepts build on each other
6. **Do the challenges** - They solidify your understanding

### Time Commitment:
- **Minimum**: 1-2 chapters per week (3-4 hours/week)
- **Recommended**: 2-3 chapters per week (6-8 hours/week)
- **Intensive**: 4-5 chapters per week (12-15 hours/week)
